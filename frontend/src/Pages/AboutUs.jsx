      bio: `Hi, I'm Dhruv â€” a tech enthusiast, lifelong learner, and the brain behind PrepNexus. My journey began with a passion for coding and a curiosity for how things work under the hood. From exploring card magic to writing scripts, I've always believed in mastering both the art and logic behind anything I do.\n\nAs someone who's been through the rollercoaster of technical interviews, I realized how overwhelming and unstructured preparation can feel. That's what inspired me to create PrepNexus â€” not just as a tool, but as a community-powered platform where interview prep is smart, structured, and actually enjoyable. This project reflects my core values: attention to detail, creative problem solving, and building with purpose. Every feature â€” from resume-based question generation to mock interviews â€” is designed to simplify the process for students, freshers, and job-seekers like you.\n\nLet's crack interviews together, one question at a time. ðŸš€`

      bio: `Hi, I'm Dhaneshâ€” a passionate developer and someone who lives and breathes computer science. From algorithms to full-stack development, I enjoy diving deep into the core of technology and building solutions that are clean, scalable, and efficient.\n\nAs a co-creator of PrepNexus, I bring a strong technical foundation and an eye for architecture and system design. Iâ€™ve always believed that a good developer doesnâ€™t just write code â€” they craft experiences, think logically, and solve real-world problems with precision. This project reflects that philosophy â€” combining structured learning with intuitive design.\n\nWhether it's building responsive interfaces, optimizing backend logic, or brainstorming new features, I'm committed to making PrepNexus a powerful tool for anyone navigating the tech interview journey.`
